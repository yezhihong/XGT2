   The experiment, E08-014, in Hall-A at Jefferson Lab aims to study the short-range correlations (SRC) which are necessary to explain the nuclear strength absent in the mean field theory. The cross sections for $\mathrm{^{2}H}$, $\mathrm{^{3}He}$, $\mathrm{^{4}He}$, $\mathrm{^{12}C}$, $\mathrm{^{40}Ca}$ and $\mathrm{^{48}Ca}$, were measured via inclusive quasielastic electron scattering from these nuclei in a $\mathrm{Q^{2}}$ range between 0.8 and $\mathrm{2.8~(GeV/c)^{2}}$ for $x_{bj}>1$. The cross section ratios of heavy nuclei to $\mathrm{^{2}H}$ were extracted to study two-nucleon SRC for $1<x_{bj}<2$, while the study of three-nucleon SRC was carried out from the cross section ratios of heavy nuclei to $\mathrm{^{3}He}$ for $x_{bj}\ge 2$. Meanwhile, the isospin dependence in SRCs has also been examined through the cross section ratio of $\mathrm{^{48}Ca}$ and $\mathrm{^{40}Ca}$.
