\section{Beam Calibration}

Electron beam is deliveried into Hall A through a stainless steel tube, which is 10 ft above the hall floor and can hold a vacuum pressure $\|e-6$ Torr. Along the beamline, there are several beam diagnotistic elements to measure and monitor the beam quality (Fig ~\ref{wholehall}).
